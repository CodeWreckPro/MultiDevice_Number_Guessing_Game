## How the Project Works

The project consists of a backend built with Spring Boot and a frontend using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key components:

- **Backend**:
  - `Application.java`: The main entry point of the Spring Boot application.
  - `GameController.java`: Handles HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service methods.
  - `GameService.java`: Contains the core game logic, such as starting/stopping the game, managing players, and processing guesses.
  - `Player.java` and `Game.java`: Models representing players and the game state, respectively.

- **Frontend**:
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the game interface.
  - `styles.css`: CSS for styling the game interface.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript for handling user interactions and communication with the backend.

- **Game Flow**:
  - When the host starts the game, all players are prompted to enter their names.
  - Players take turns describing a number with a prompt within 30 seconds.
  - Other players then guess the number within the next 30 seconds.
  - The game cycles through all players for three rounds and then displays the final scores.

## Game Rules

1. Players enter their names to join.
2. The game cycles through each player, who must enter a number and a prompt within 30 seconds.
3. Other players guess the number based on the prompt within 30 seconds.
4. The game repeats for three rounds.
5. Scores are calculated and displayed at the end.
